# [Azimuth](http://github.com/mcrider/azimuth)

Azimuth is a simple, elegant, and fast CMS built using meteor.js.

***Note: Azimuth is currently in early alpha; I'm still working out code design and many features are not yet implemented.***

## Prerequisites


* Install meteor.js: `curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh`
* Install meteorite: `sudo npm install -g meteorite`

You can then run Azimuth by cloning this repository and running `mrt` from the root directory.  This will make Azimuth accessible from http://localhost:3000 by default.  I recommend forking this repository and pushing any changes to your forked repo (and please feel free to make pull requests with your custom blocks, pages, or core fixes).  

To administer Azimuth, create a user account -- the first user account will be the admin user.  From there you can edit your site from the admin menu in the top right corner of the page.
